// independent (non-GPL) LZO1X decompressor in TypeScript
/**
 * LZO1X-1 decompression.
 *
 * Why this exists at all: a Gbx body is LZO-compressed, and every LZO
 * implementation that descends from Oberhumer's `minilzo` - including the
 * `lzo-ts` package this replaces - is GPL-3.0. Shipping one to the browser is
 * conveying it, which put the whole client bundle under the GPL for the sake
 * of two hundred lines of decompressor. This is an independent implementation
 * of the published LZO1X bitstream, written from the format description (the
 * same basis as the MIT-licensed `lzokay` and its Rust and Go ports), so
 * nothing copyleft ships and the licence of this project is a free choice
 * again.
 *
 * Decompression only. Nothing here writes a .Gbx, and a compressor is the half
 * with the patents-and-tuning folklore in it; `compress` therefore refuses
 * rather than pretending.
 *
 * Correctness is not taken on trust: `npm run verify:lzo` round-trips several
 * thousand buffers - random, runs, text, real Gbx-shaped data and the edge
 * cases each branch below needs - through a reference compressor and this
 * decompressor, and compares byte for byte.
